# 🚀 PMT Leech
#### A Parallel Memory Transactions Monitor

</p>

**PMT Leech** is a hardware + software tool that lets you monitor live memory accesses from a CPU to an external parallel memory chip.  
It streams transactions in real-time, while giving you full control over the system clock — allowing **pausing, stepping, and instruction-level debugging**.

---

## 🔧 When Should You Use PMT Leech?

PMT Leech is especially useful when working with **older electronic systems** that meet these two conditions:
- ✅ The system uses a **parallel memory chip** (like SRAM or EPROM)
- ✅ The CPU operates with an **external clock input**

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

By attaching PMT Leech to your memory chip (via clipper) and supplying your own clock signal to the CPU:
- You gain **live streaming** of memory transactions
- You can **pause or step** through firmware execution  
- You can **reverse engineer or debug** embedded firmware in a safe, controlled way

</p>

- 🧩 Configurable pinout: Supports 28, 30, or 32-pin chips
- 📡 Live recording of transactions (up to 70kHz)
- 🎨 Interactive memory viewer with color-coded highlights
- ⏱ Step by **clock** or **instruction**
- 🧠 Detect and label **foreign packets** (from other devices on the memory bus)
- 💾 Off-circuit memory read/write with chip socket

## 📋 Requirements

### ✅ Memory Chip
- Parallel bus
- ≤ 8-bit data
- ≤ 18 address lines
- 5V compatible (or use 330Ω series resistors)

### ✅ CPU
- Must allow external clock input
- 5V compatible (or 330Ω resistors)

### ⚠️ Note on Timing
The CPU will be **underclocked** (e.g., 8 MHz → 50 kHz). This may affect peripherals like UART:
- Ex: 9600 baud becomes ~60 baud — comms may break.

## 🧠 Supported Memory Types

- EEPROM
- EPROM
- SRAM — **especially valuable** for volatile firmware systems

💡 Many older systems used **SRAM for firmware** due to speed advantages. PMT Leech lets you read these **volatile** setups **without desoldering**.

---

## 🔍 Example Use Cases

- **Bypass password protection**: Record firmware transactions during password validation and discover comparison logic or values.
- **Firmware reverse engineering**: Step through opcode streams and infer instruction flow.
- **Brownout glitching**: Control timing to inject faults and analyze behavior.
